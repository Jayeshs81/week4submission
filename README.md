# week4submission

The Objective of this application is to diagramatically display the growth of phone usage in the different geographic regions between 1951 and 1961.

For this purpose we use the WorldPhones dataset.

WorldPhones provides information about the number of phones in the different regions and years in a matrix form.

The Shiny app can be accessed here - http://jayeshs81.shinyapps.io/Week4Submission

Our Shiny app, allows you to plot the # of phone depending on which years and regions you are interested in. 

To use the Shiny app:  
- Select the Region(s) which you want to display in the plot   
- Select the Year(s) which you want to display in the plot

On changing the selection of the region or the year check boxes a new plot is created in the main panel.
